# luggage_timeline
Create events to be displayed in a sequential timeline view.

This feature creates a content type called Timeline Event. These events can be displayed in a View, which shows a vertical list of each event from oldest to newest, in an alternating style. 

The CSS is optimized for the Suitcase Interim theme.
